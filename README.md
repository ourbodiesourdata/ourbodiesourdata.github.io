### Recommendations for use
-	Carefully review who is hosting the archived data, when the latest update was, and who was responsible for archiving (if available)
-	If 2 or more archived sources for the same data are available, compare the sources for discrepancies
-	Download and store data on a personal hard drive as soon as you know you need it

### If using federal data that was removed and then returned to federal servers
- We strongly recommend that you compare this data to archived data or prior papers written using the same data source to check for omissions or changes.
